		<h2>How the Website works.</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><h3>Registration.</h3>
				To use the Website, Seller must register by having a duly authorized representative (“Seller’s Representative”) enter all information required at [link].  Upon registration by Seller, DanceRialto.com will create an account for Seller.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><h3>Product Information.</h3>
				Seller shall be responsible for:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Determining the price of each item listed for sale by Seller and enter this amount into the website</li>
					<li>Designating each item listed as either a Standard Return Item or a No- Return Item</li>
					<li>Submitting accurate pricing and other information about each item listed, including product descriptions, product images and related content (collectively, “Content”).</li>
					<li>Providing a flat rate for both international and domestic shipping cost for each item listed</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><h3>All sales transactions are between Seller and Customer.</h3>
				The Website permits customers to purchase Seller’s products directly from Seller, paying all amounts due with a credit card through the website.  Seller shall be solely responsible for fulfilling each order.  All sales conducted through the Website shall constitute sales between Seller and the customer only.  DanceRialto.com shall have no contractual relationship with the customer other than to assist in transmitting payments and other information between Seller and the customer.  DanceRialto.com is not the agent for Seller or the customer, and has no authority to act for or bind either Seller or the customer.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><h3>Charges to Customer.</h3>
				For each order, the Website shall calculate: (i) the total sales price(s) for the item(s) ordered; (ii) total shipping cost; and (iii) DanceRialto’s commission, which shall be seventeen percent (17%) of the total transaction cost. Transaction cost is the total of the item price and shipping.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><h3>Shipping Costs.</h3>
				For each item shipped, the shipping cost shall be determined based on the address of the buyer and seller to be either the domestic or international rate as provided by the seller at the time of listing the item.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><h3>Order Fulfillment.</h3>
				Seller will be promptly notified by email of each sale after payment has been received unencumbered by DanceRialto (“Receipt of Payment”).  Seller shall be responsible for: (i) packaging and shipping the item(s) within ten (10) business days after Receipt of Payment; and (ii) promptly confirming shipment and delivery by entering the shipment tracking information onto the Website.  DanceRialto or the customer may cancel any sale for which Seller fails to ship or fails to provide tracking information, regardless of whether the item has been shipped or not,  within said ten (10)-day period.</p>

					<li>Payments for orders delivered (as reflected in shipment tracking information), less DanceRialto’s commission, will be promptly credited to Seller’s account after the earlier of: (1) notification by the customer to DanceRialto that the customer is fully satisfied; or (2) ten (10) business days after the date of delivery (as reflected in shipment tracking information), provided that there has been no return, request for refund, replacement or return authorization, or other dispute with the customer within said ten (10)-day period.</li>

							</li>
							<li>

								<ol>
									<li>
										<p><h5>Available Funds.</h5>

										<p>Transfers to Seller’s account may take up to five (5) days after the transfer is initiated.  Electronic payment may not be available if Seller’s bank will not accept an electronic credit. Payments shall be made only on business days (other than weekends or U.S. legal holidays).</p>
